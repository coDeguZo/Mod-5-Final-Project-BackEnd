## Summary 

This is a sports news aggregator designed to get all of your daily news in the sports world, as well as in the NBA.  A user can either sign-up or sign-in and follow NBA teams or players, and read up on their favorite sports teams.  If you dont want to follow a player, no problem!  You can unfollow a player or team and continue using the app.  If there is a spcific news article you like go ahead and bookmark it, and read it later on your profile page!  I hope you enjoy using my app and continue following some of the best sports news in the world!

(Due to changes to the News API CORS restrictions, news will need to be updated by seeding the backend postgreSQL database)
